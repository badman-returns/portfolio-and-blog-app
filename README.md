# Personal Blog and Portfolio
This project is all about creating web application where I will write blogs about my current projects I will be building and working on as well as will contain list of softwares and tools I have created.
This application contains a seperate backend and a frontend.

### Technology Stack
This web application is going to be built on top of microservice architechture.
##### Frontend
* [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Bootstrap] - Build Fast Responsive with Bootstrap
* [CKEditor] - Smart WYSIWYG editor components with collaborative editing
##### Backend
* [Nodejs] - Free, open-sourced, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment
* [TypeScript] - TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types. TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you     
 run code.
* [JSON Web Token] - JWT for Authentication & Authorization
* [MYSQL] -  Database 

### Development
Requires [MYSQL] service to run and create database.
Start the MYSQL database service before starting backend.

To run the backend server
```
$ cd backend
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
For Frontend Development
```
$ cd frontend
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Work is on progress will be uploaded soon.
